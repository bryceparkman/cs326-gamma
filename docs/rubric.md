| Costs page      | Non-intuitive UI, and limited to no HTML modification. Server communication is below project specifications and the page is barely functional. Many obvious bugs with no multi-user features.   |          |          | Page has understandable UI, robust HTML modification, and communicates with the server and PostgreSQL db via CRUD api routes. Users are able to add any type of payment (rent or utility) and the progress bars update accordingly. Page works seamlessly with multiple users, and there are no visible bugs.                                                                   |

Many obvious bugs with no multi-user features.   |          |          | Page has understandable UI, robust HTML modification, and communicates with the server and PostgreSQL db via CRUD api routes. Users are able to add grocery bills easily and the progress bar should update accordingly. Adding, editing, and removing groceries should all be quick and intuitive. Page works seamlessly with multiple users, and there are no visible bugs.   |
| Apartment pages | Apartment creation page is barely functional, and has no way of being accessed without direct URL routing. Data is not sent through a CRUD api to the PostgreSQL database, and there are many visible bugs and design flaws. Apartment overview page is also barely functional, and has many present bugs and design flaws. Data is not collected accurately and no changes whatsoever can be made to the apartment database. |          |          | Apartment creation page is intuitive and responsive. Page is correctly routed to after login and uses the CRUD api to add the apartment information to the PostgreSQL database, connecting the user profiles in the process. Apartment overview page correctly displays data in an easy to understand way. All facets of the apartment are visible and the individual components of the apartment are able to be tweaked. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
| Authentication  | Signup, login, and log out are non-intuitive and cumbersome/slow to use. Obvious security flaws such as non-hashed passwords or incorrect password validation. No routes require authorization. |          |          | Sign up, log in, and log out are all intuitive and accessible. Password are hashed are there are no security flaws whatsoever. Certain pages should only be accessible via authorization of the currently logged in user. API routes to communicate with the PostgreSQL database should be used, and no obvious exploits should be visible.                                     |
| Server          | CRUD routes barely present, and there are many extraneous routes and unusuded code. Multiple instances of hard-coded data not utilizing the PostgreSQL database. |          |          | All types of CRUD api routes should be present, and there are no extraneous routes not in use. No hard-coded data or locally stored databases allowed. All data retrieved and sent should go to the PostgreSQL database.                                                                                                                                                        |
