## Overview

ExpenseMate is a website to help people track their apartments' or households' shared monthly expenses. The main features of the site are pages to manage progress made on monthly bills, such as rent and utilities, and a running grocery list and inventory of the goods needed and bought by the users of the apartment/household. Users start by creating an account and then either joining, or creating, an apartment where they can define the costs of each of the apartment's bills; and expenses can be dividied up evenly or proportionally depending on what the housemates set. Once created, the apartment overview page lets users see their personal progress on their bills as well the apartment's overall progress on expenses. By tracking all apartment expenses, people no longer feel like they are paying more or less than their share because every apartment expense is documented and easily readable. The site solves a challenge many young people face when living with a group of people - especially for those who aren't used to managing expenses. It allows for an objective financial breakdown of shared expenses and the running grocery list solves the problem of overbuying and miscommunication which saves all users time and money.

## Authentication/Authorization

Users are authenticated at login when they correctly input their email/password. If unauthenticated, users can only see the homepage, and signup/login pages. When a user is first created they can input their apartment ID if they are joining an existing apartment, if not they are redirected to the apartment creation page. Once a user is logged in and part of an aprtment they have access to all pages.

## Division of Labor: 

Leon worked on: The creation of the apartment creation and apartment overview pages(apt-creation.html, apt-overview.html), and the associated javascript scripts for each. All the styling for these pages was done by me in styles.css. I added all API routes associated with apartment creation and editing/adding/removing/retrieving apartment costs, and contributed to all documentation.

Hannah worked on: The creation the homepage, login, and signup pages (specifically index.html, login.html, login.js, signup.html, and signup.js). Also the API routes for these pages: which inclule checking for a unique email, getting a user's password upon login, and adding new users to the database when created. I also worked on the documentation for the data model and the final.md doc.

Bryce worked on: The creation of the navbar, costs, and groceries pages (costs.html, groceries.html). All the CSS for these pages was also done by me. I also created the associated javascript scripts for those pages. I added all the API routes related to groceries, inventory, budgets, and payments. Finally, I created secrets.json, deployed on Heroku, and contributed to all the documentation.
