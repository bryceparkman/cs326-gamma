## Overview

ExpenseMate is a website to help people track their apartments' or households' shared monthly expenses. The main features of the site are pages to manage progress made on monthly bills, such as rent and utilities, and a running grocery list and inventory of the goods needed and bought by the users of the apartment/household. Users start by creating an account and then either joining, or creating, an apartment where they can define the costs of each of the apartment's bills; and expenses can be dividied up evenly or proportionally depending on what the housemates set. Once created, the apartment overview page lets users see their personal progress on their bills as well the apartment's overall progress on expenses. By tracking all apartment expenses, people no longer feel like they are paying more or less than their share because every apartment expense is documented and easily readable. The site solves a challenge many young people face when living with a group of people - especially for those who aren't used to managing expenses. It allows for an objective financial breakdown of shared expenses and the running grocery list solves the problem of overbuying and miscommunication which saves all users time and money.
