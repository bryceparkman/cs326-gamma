## Innovative Idea

Our project idea was to create a website to help people keep track of apartment life, focusing on rent and groceries. The site is meant to keep track of group (housemate) expenses rather than just personal finances which makes it different than other budgeting apps out there like Mint or acorns. The idea is that each person can make their own personal account with one person creating the 'apartment' and could invite other group members. The person who created the apartment can set initial expenses like rent, utilities, wifi, or whatever expenses the apartment has. The expenses can be dividied up evenly or proportionally depending on the apartment; allowing each member to track how much they have to pay or to just manage their overall finances. Users can see how close they are to paying their expenses and the site would be able to remind them of important dates for payments. The website will also track non-definitive expenses like groceries or needed household items with a running grocery list that people can add what they need to or check off items they bought. This solves the problem of overbuying and miscommunication and should in turn save everyone more time and money. Grocery expenses can be dividied up (again either evenly or proportionally to suit users needs). By tracking all apartment expenses, people no longer feel like they are paying more or less than their share, as every apartment expense is documented and easily readable. 



## Important Components

There will be a main homepage showing how close the user is to completing their payments as well as an overview of the groups expenses. To track how close users are to completing their payments, the site will have a progress bar that updates as they get closer. Since sometimes people only want to pay for their own food and not in a group - lists and goods can be color coded by which user requested them which user bought them to make it easy to  pay for your own groceries even if bought by another group member. There will also be a function of sending email reminders when payments are due or when new expenses are added that users can opt in for. One main function of the site will be to calculate and divide all expenses up so that users just see a number they owe; this would be done in the initial setup of the apartment with either an even split of all required expenses or the creator setting proportional expenses; regardless the site should calculate individual expenses based on all group expenses.
