## Innovative Idea

Our project idea was to create a website to help people keep track of apartment life, focusing on rent and groceries. The site is meant to keep track of group expenses rather than just personal finances. This makes it different than other budgeting apps out there like Mint or Acorns. The idea is that one person can set up the apartment on the website and then invite the other members to the apartment via email. The person who created the apartment can set initial expenses like rent, utilities, wifi, or whatever other expenses the apartment has. The expenses can be dividied up evenly or proportionally depending on what the roomates set. This allows each member to track how much they have to pay or to just manage the apartment's overall finances. Users can see how close they are to paying their expenses and the site would be able to remind them of important payment dates. The website will also track other expenses like groceries or  missing household items. This would utilize a running grocery list that people can add what they need to or check off items they bought. This solves the problem of overbuying and miscommunication which should save everyone more time and money. Grocery expenses can be divided up either evenly or proportionally to suit users needs. By tracking all apartment expenses, people no longer feel like they are paying more or less than their share because every apartment expense is documented and easily readable. 



## Important Components

The apartment will feature standard login and signup pages. There will be a main homepage showing how close the user is to completing their payments as well as an overview of the groups expenses. To track how close users are to completing their payments, the site will have a progress bar that updates as they get closer. Since sometimes people only want to pay for their own food and not in a group - lists and goods can be color coded by which user requested them and which user bought them. This will make it easy to pay for your own groceries even if it was bought by another group member. There will also be a system of email reminders when payments are due or when new expenses are added that users can opt in for. One main function of the site will be to calculate and divide all expenses up so that users just see a number they owe; this would be done in the initial setup of the apartment with either an even split of all required expenses or the creator setting proportional expenses; regardless, the site should calculate individual expenses based on all group expenses. This split can be adjusted at any point if every user agrees to the change. Options to leave an apartment will also be part of the website. For this project, we are assuming only one apartment group per user.
