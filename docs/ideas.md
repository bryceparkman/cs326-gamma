## Innovative Idea

Our project idea was to create a website to help people keep track of apartment life, focusing on rent and groceries. The site is meant to keep track of group (housemate) expenses rather than just personal finances which makes it different than other budgeting apps out there like Mint or acorns. The idea is that each person can make their own personal account with one person creating the 'apartment' and the other group members can join (through invite or code or something). The person who created the apartment can set initial expenses like rent, utilities, wifi, or whatever expenses the apartment has. The expenses can be dividied up evenly or proportionally depending on the apartment; allowing each member to track how much they have to pay or to just manage their overall finances. Users can see how close they are to paying their expenses with a progress bar and even remind them of important dates for payments. The website will also track non-definitive expenses like groceries or needed household items with a function to keep a running grocery list that people can add what they need to or check off items they bought. From there, grocery expenses can be dividied up (again either evenly or proportionally to suit users needs). By tracking all apartment expenses, people no longer feel like they are paying more or less than their share, as every apartment expense is documented and easily readable.
